My academic excellence is underpinned by a perfect GPA at Cornell and significant achievements at Beijing Normal University and the University of Pennsylvania.

# Finance Contributions

## 💼 Private Equity Investments
During my internships with China Greater Bay Area Tech Fund, CICC, and Shenzhen Capital Group, I have analyzed and valued tech and healthcare companies, developed investment strategies, and participated in high-stakes negotiations and presentations. These experiences have honed my ability to navigate complex financial landscapes and contribute to the growth of private equity investments.

# Technology Contributions

## 🤖 Quantitative Analysis and Fintech Innovations
At Deep Trading and Tencent, I utilized my technical skills in Python and R to develop algorithms for trading strategies and asset allocation. My work includes real-time data analysis, API integration, and deploying cloud-based solutions to enhance financial decision-making processes.

Passionate about spreading knowledge, I have taken leadership roles in organizing and hosting discussions with venture capitalists at the UPenn Quaker Venture Club, and I am dedicated to volunteering in efforts that promote educational equality and financial literacy.
